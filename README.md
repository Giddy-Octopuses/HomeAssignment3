- Assignment Duration: 2 weeks
- Contributors: Annalena, Emma, Gabija

## Project description
We chose the data about Student Performance and created six different charts.

## Instruction
- When you open the application, you'll not see any charts. 
- You need to choose a query from the list, and click Add. The chart will appear on the screen.
    - Those queries which are currently displayed won't appear in the list, so you can't add them more than once.
- If you want to delete a chart, click on it, so the Delete button appears.
